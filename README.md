## 🧠 Overview  

**AutoRebar** is a focused engineering application created to automate reinforcement detailing for reinforced concrete structures. It assists engineers and detailers in producing clear, consistent rebar layouts for elements such as retaining walls, slabs, beams, and columns with minimal manual input.

By embedding design logic and configurable rules, AutoRebar transforms structural data into precise drawings, bar shapes, and schedules. This approach reduces drafting time, minimizes errors, and improves coordination across structural documentation.

Built for Windows environments, AutoRebar fits smoothly into professional structural workflows and supports efficient delivery of construction-ready drawings.
